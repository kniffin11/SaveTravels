# SaveTravels
Deployed on AWS ec2 instance, http://3.88.174.254/ Ubuntu 20.04 OS. 
I will update to include many to many relationship and the Open Table API for a more technically sound application soon, I'm still working out a few bugs. Save travels is a java full CRUD application that uses Spring tool suite and corresponding framework, OAuth for login/reg security, and MySQL for a db.
